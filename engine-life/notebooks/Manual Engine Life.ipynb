    "# Predicting Remaining Useful Life with Manual Feature Engineering\n",
    "\n",
    "In this notebook, we will work with NASA provided data to accomplish a critical real-world task: predict the remaining useful life of an engine. Our first attempt will be to tackle this problem by hand, building features based on aggregations, domain knowledge (if applicable), and time-series based methods. The original data can be downloaded [here.](https://ti.arc.nasa.gov/tech/dash/groups/pcoe/prognostic-data-repository/#turbofan)"

    "## Roadmap \n",
    "\n",
    "Following will be our approach to this problem:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. Specify the prediction problem\n",
    "    * For each engine, define the cutoff point and label\n",
    "2. Subset data to before cutoff point for each engine\n",
    "3. Establish a baseline performance measure\n",
    "4. Perform basic aggregations for each engine to develop features\n",
    "    * Use feature selection to reduce the number of features\n",
    "5. Evaluate performance of features \n",
    "    * In cross validation on the training data \n",
    "    * On the testing data\n",
    "6. Try more sophisticated feature engineering\n",
    "    * Time-series analysis\n",
    "    * KMeans clustering\n",
    "7. Evaluate performance of new features\n",
    "    * Use feature selection\n",
    "8. Perform random search to tune the random forest model\n",
    "\n",
    "This problem is a good basic introduction to time-series prediction. Even though we have all the data for all the engines, when we make features, we have to limit ourselves to data from before the cutoff time in order to ensure our model trains on valid data."

    "There were many more operations we could have applied to the data to generate features that we did not. For manual feature engineering, we are limited only by our imagination and patience. However, once we get to a certain level of performance, squeezing out every last bit of accuracy is secondary to [model interpretability](https://www.oreilly.com/learning/introduction-to-local-interpretable-model-agnostic-explanations-lime). We might want to forgo complex operations and sacrifice a minor bit of performance in order to create a more interpretable model. \n",

Nonetheless, manual feature engineering is still time-consuming, error-prone, and does not translate between problems because we have to completely re-write the code for each dataset. In the next notebook, we will implement automated feature engineering using [Featuretools](https://www.featuretools.com/), which is significantly more efficient, can be applied to any dataset with only minor changes in syntax, and will allow us to create hundreds or thousands of features which are not limited by our creavity or our time."
